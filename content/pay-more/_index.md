title: "Pay More for the Course"
---
First, let us say **thank you** for the generosity expressed by just clicking the link to learn about paying more.

With that said, we hope you won't feel dismayed that **we are not currently allowing for learners to pay more than $100/week.**

However, if, after you've completed the course, you feel compelled by gratitude to contribute more, you'll be able to do so -- both as a one-time contribution, as well as on an ongoing basis for membership in the community.

So, for now, we just ask that you enroll at one of the levels available on the [Join Page](https://sjmd.space/join/#sign-up), and focus on making the most out of the course -- learning, teaching, and applying the lessons in your social justice work.

Then, when the time comes, if you're still feeling generous, you can send more dollars our way.
