**Yes.** Absolutely. We do not want money, or not having a credit card, to be a barrier preventing anyone from joining the Course and Community.

In fact, we would have had a $0 option directly on the sign up page if our Membership software supported it.

If you want to participate without paying, **the only thing we need you to do is prove to us that you're you.**

While the members of the course will remain anonymous to one another, we need to verify that only real humans are signing up for the course, and that a person can only enroll once -- we do this as a safety measure.

So, here's what we ask you to do to verify who you are:

- Email [team@sjmd.space](mailto:team@sjmd.space?subject=Verifying%20Identity%20to%20Join%20Course) from your personal email address
- Make the subject "Verifying Identity to Join Course"
- If your name isn't attached to your email account, tell us your name
- Include a link to as many active social media profiles as you have under your name (e.g., your Facebook profile, Twitter, Instagram, as long as those accounts aren't anonymous)
- To prove that you're the owner of those accounts, make a public post on one of them that includes the hashtag "#sjmd" or mentions that you're trying to join the course (it's okay if you delete this after we've verified you!)
- Finally, link us to that post


Give us a day or two to check the links, then we'll enroll you or follow up!

<small class="blue-700">**Note:** If you can't do any of these steps, just explain to us why in the email, and provide an alternative way to prove you're you. We're flexible!</small>
